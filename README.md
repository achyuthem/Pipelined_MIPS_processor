# Pipelined_MIPS_processor

Verilog code for the design of a single cycle, pipelined, 5-stage MIPS processor.

The advantage of this processor is that data hazards are detected and resolved, hence eliminating the need for inserting stalls for instructions dependent on data. However, Control hazards are resolved by using stalls.
